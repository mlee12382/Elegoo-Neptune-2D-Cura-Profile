## Overview 

This is the Cura profile that was made by ELEGOO and I modified it to work with the newest version of cura and removed some unused defaults. I have also added the STL of the bed from the original Neptune 2 STEP files

## How to install
<b>Hard</b>: Just download the master zip and drop the contents into your cura install folder or Appdata

<b>Easy</b>: Download the plugin version from the [Releases](https://github.com/Toylerrr/ELEGOO_Neptune2_Cura/releases) section and drag and drop into the cura windows
